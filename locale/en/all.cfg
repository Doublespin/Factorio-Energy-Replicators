[item-description]
ion-conduit=A hypermagnetic solid-state electron cluster.  Used for high-energy electronics.
replicator-1=Converts raw electricity to matter.  Simple materials only.
replicator-2=Converts raw electricity to matter, twice as fast, but much less efficient.  Can replicate secondary materials.
replicator-3=Converts raw electricity to matter, twice again as fast, even less efficient.  Can replicated advanced materials.
replicator-4=Converts raw electricity to matter, twice again as fast, very inefficient.  Can replicate simple components.
replicator-5=Converts raw electricity to matter, twice again as fast, extremely inefficient.  Can replicate advanced components.
